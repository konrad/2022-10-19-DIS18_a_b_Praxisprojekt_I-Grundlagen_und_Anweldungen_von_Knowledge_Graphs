# Open Research Knowledge Graphs

<summary> ORKG -  Open Research Knowledge Graphs </summary>
    
#### The Organization

The ORKG is a Organisation with the goal to make scientific papers better findable. 
ORKG achieves this by structuring the research papers using Knowledge Graphs.
This also makes it easier to peer review a paper.
THE ORKG uses RDF as as Base for Knowledge Graph Development.

#### Funding

The ORKG receives funding through grants from the European Research Council (ERC).

#### Overview of the History of ORKG 

https://orkg.org/about/11/History 

#### Gitlab

-ORKG has a  Open Source Gitlab with a lot of information to their Natural Language Processing algorithms, Back- Frontend Information, Special Feature for Covid-19, Ontology and more.

    <summary> Main focus of ORKG </summary>

### The Problem
- The science community has communicated the same way since its upcoming.
- Approximately 2,5 million scientific articles are published yearly
- Because of missing structure, researchers cant find relevant papers. (Research flood)

- Causes a scientific crisis:
    - Results can't be reproduced
    - Lack of peer reviewed papers
    - Even in small science field peers drown in a information flood
    - Ultimalely the loss of knowledge occurs
    
### The Solution
    
- "The ORKG makes scientific knowledge human- and machine-actionable and thus enables completely new ways of machine assistance."

- This makes finding the right papers easier and creates more opportuninty for comparisons and reviews.
- Using ORGK, researchers can explore more knowledge and share results over different disciplines.

### Other Activities
	
#### Workshops

- ORKG offers Workshops with topics like:
    - Front- Backend developments
    - Beyond research data infrastructures - exploiting artificial & crowd intelligence for building research knowledge graphs
    - Ontology-driven Research in Material Science
    - And many more
    
#### Events
	
 - ORKG joins and hosts webinars as well as live events with speakers

<summary>Problems in science</summary>

### - Science papers haven't changed over many years. <br /> Science is still today mostly on pdfs, which are really bad for machines to read.
### - Reproducibility is very low
### - Root cause: its hard to communicate with other scientists
