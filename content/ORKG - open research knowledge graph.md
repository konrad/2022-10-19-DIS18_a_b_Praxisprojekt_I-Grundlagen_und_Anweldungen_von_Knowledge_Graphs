<summary> ORKG -  Open Research Knowledge Graphs </summary>
    
#### The Organization

The ORKG is a Organisation with the goal to make scientific papers better findable. 
ORKG achieves this by structuring the research papers using Knowledge Graphs.
This also makes it easier to peer review a paper.
THE ORKG uses RDF as as Base for Knowledge Graph Development.

#### Funding

The ORKG receives funding through grants from the European Research Council (ERC).

#### Overview of the History of ORKG

    <summary> Main focus of ORKG </summary>

### The Problem
- The science community has communicated the same way since its upcoming.
- Approximately 2,5 million scientific articles are published yearly
- Because of missing structure, researchers cant find relevant papers. (Research flood)

- Causes a scientific crisis:
    - Results can't be reproduced
    - Lack of peer reviewed papers
    - Even in small science field peers drown in a information flood
    - Ultimalely the loss of knowledge occurs
    
### The Solution
    
- "The ORKG makes scientific knowledge human- and machine-actionable and thus enables completely new ways of machine assistance."

- This makes finding the right papers easier and creates more opportuninty for comparisons and reviews.
- Using ORGK, researchers can explore more knowledge and share results over different disciplines.
